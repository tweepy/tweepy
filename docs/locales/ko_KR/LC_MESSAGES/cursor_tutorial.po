"We use pagination a lot in Twitter API development. Iterating through "
"timelines, user lists, direct messages, etc. In order to perform "
"pagination, we must supply a page/cursor parameter with each of our "
"requests. The problem here is this requires a lot of boiler plate code "
"just to manage the pagination loop. To help make pagination easier and "
"require less code, Tweepy has the Cursor object."

"First let's demonstrate iterating the statuses in the authenticated "
"user's timeline. Here is how we would do it the \"old way\" before the "
"Cursor object was introduced::"

"As you can see, we must manage the \"page\" parameter manually in our "
"pagination loop. Now here is the version of the code using the Cursor "
"object::"

"Now that looks much better! Cursor handles all the pagination work for us"
" behind the scenes, so our code can now focus entirely on processing the "
"results."

"Since we pass Cursor the callable, we can not pass the parameters "
"directly into the method. Instead we pass the parameters into the Cursor "
"constructor method::"
