class Tweet(HashableID, DataMapping):
    """Tweets are the basic building block of all things Twitter. The Tweet
    object has a long list of ‘root-level’ fields, such as ``id``, ``text``,
    and ``created_at``. Tweet objects are also the ‘parent’ object to several
    child objects including ``user``, ``media``, ``poll``, and ``place``. Use
    the field parameter ``tweet.fields`` when requesting these root-level
    fields on the Tweet object.

    The Tweet object that can be found and expanded in the user resource.
    Additional Tweets related to the requested Tweet can also be found and
    expanded in the Tweet resource. The object is available for expansion with
    ``?expansions=pinned_tweet_id`` in the user resource or
    ``?expansions=referenced_tweets.id`` in the Tweet resource to get the
    object with only default fields. Use the expansion with the field
    parameter: ``tweet.fields`` when requesting additional fields to complete
    the object.

    .. versionadded:: 4.0

    .. versionchanged:: 4.11
        Added ``edit_history_tweet_ids`` and ``edit_controls`` fields

    edit_history_tweet_ids : list[int]
        Unique identifiers indicating all versions of a Tweet. For Tweets with
        no edits, there will be one ID. For Tweets with an edit history, there
        will be multiple IDs, arranged in ascending order reflecting the order

        Creation time of the Tweet.
    edit_controls : dict | None
        When present, this indicates how much longer the Tweet can be edited
        and the number of remaining edits. Tweets are only editable for the
        first 30 minutes after creation and can be edited up to five times.
    entities : dict | None
        Entities which have been parsed out of the text of the Tweet.
        Additionally see entities in Twitter Objects.

        if they specified one.
    in_reply_to_user_id : int | None
        If the represented Tweet is a reply, this field will contain the

        A list of Tweets this Tweet refers to. For example, if the parent Tweet
        is a Retweet, a Retweet with comment (also known as Quoted Tweet) or a
        Reply, it will include the related Tweet referenced to by its parent.
    reply_settings : str | None
        Shows you who can reply to a given Tweet. Fields returned are
        "everyone", "mentioned_users", and "followers".
