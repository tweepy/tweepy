All changes made to the library that might affect applications
during upgrade will be listed here.

1.3 -> 1.4 [Future release]
===========================
+ Added people search API method. API.search_users()
+ Streaming API
    - Moved parameters into POST body to prevent "head too big" errors.
    - Stream can be run either asynchronously (threaded) or synchronously (blocks main thread).
      By default Stream will run in sync. mode. To change this pass into the stream
      method 'async=True'. Example:
          s = Stream('test', 'password', MyListener())
          s.sample(async=True)  # threaded mode
          s.filter(track=['pizza']) # synch./blocking mode
    - Listener now has a "on_data" method which can be overridden to manually handle the
        raw stream data.
+ tweepyshell
    - allow using getpass for more secure password collection
      new usage: tweepyshell <username> [password] <-- optional now
    - enable debug mode with '-d' flag
+ API
	- retweet() method now works correctly
    - Added local trends method: trends_available() and trends_location()
	- send_direct_message() now accepts either a user/screen_name/user_id for recipient of DM
    - update_status() added 'source' parameter for Identi.ca
    - create_list() and update_list() added 'description' parameter
+ tweepy.debug() enables httplib debug mode
+ New Sphinx documentation (Thanks Kumar!) in doc/
+ User model
    - Fix timeline() to return correct timeline
    - Remove mentions() method

1.2 -> 1.3 [Current release]
=====================
+ Lists API methods added
+ API.verify_credentials() now returns an User object if credentials
    are valid. Otherwise false will be returned.
+ API.new() removed
+ Removed model validation. Prone to breakage due to API changes.
+ Moved documentation out of api.py and into wiki.
+ Removed 'email' parameter from API.update_profile. No longer supported.
+ API.auth_handler -> API.auth
+ Moved memcache implementation to tweepy-more repository.
+ Tweepy now uses the versioned API and the new api.twitter.com subdomain
+ Updated retweet parsing for new payload format

1.1 -> 1.2
=====================
+ API
    + Added automatic request re-try feature
        Example: API.friends(retry_count=5, retry_delay=10)
                Retry up to 5 times with a delay of 10 seconds between each attempt.
        See tutorial/t4.py for more an example.
    + Added cursor parameter to API.friends and API.followers methods.
      Note: page parameter is being deprecated by twitter on 10/26
    + Update parsing to handle cursor responses.
        When using 'cursor' parameter, the API method will return
        a tuple with this format: (data, next_cursor, prev_cursor)
        Calls not using the 'cursor' parameter are not changed in the way they return.
    + API.friends_ids and API.followers_ids now return a list of integers.
      Parser updated to handle cursor responses. See above.
    + Fix Status.source_url parsing
    + Fix search result 'source' parsing to properly unescape html and extract source
    + Added report_spam method

+ Cursor
    Added the Cursor object to help with pagination within the API.
    Please see the pagination tutorial for more details (tutorial/t6).
    This is the recommended way for using the 'page' and 'cursor' parameters.

+ Models
    + Status: added retweet, favorite and retweets methods
      (NOTE: retweet API not live yet on twitter)

+ Python 2.4 support

+ Update OAuth bundled library.

- Logging removed. Having our own mini-logging system just feels like overkill.
  Turns out it was not really needed that much. Simply just exposing the last
  HTTPResponse object should be good enough for most debugging.

1.0.1 -> 1.1
=======================
+ Fixes
    + Google App Engine fixes (thanks Thomas Bohmbach, Jr)
+ API
    + Added Retweet API methods
    + Added Retweet Streaming method
    + New model: Retweet
    + Updated statuses parser to handle retweet_details
    + Added new parameters for statuses/update; lat & long
    + friends_ids() & followers_ids() parameter changed page -> cursor
    + search() added "locale" parameter
    + expose last httplib.HTTPResponse object received as API.last_response
+ OAuthHandler
    + Added set_request_token() method
    + Added support for "sign in with twitter".
      get_authorization_url() now takes a boolean that when
      true uses the "sign in with twitter" flow.
      See http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Sign-in-with-Twitter
+ Logging
    + Added TweepyLogger interface which allows applications
      to collect log messages from Tweepy for debugging purposes.
    + Dummy, console, and file loggers available
+ Examples
    + Appengine demo (oauth)
+ Documentation of each method in api.py

1.0 -> 1.0.1
============
